# Comparative-analysis-Drowsiness-Detector-using-MRL Dataset and transfer learning models Resnet-MobileNet-and-VGG16

As a part of my Deep Learning Mini Project 1 - I did a comparative analysis of Drowsiness Detection using MRL Dataset and 3 different transfer learning models - Mobilenet, Resnet and VVG16.
I evaluated the performance based on accuracy, precision and recall. My focus was mainly on precision and recall as I did not want false alarms as well as missing out when the driver is actually drowsy.
This project helped me to conclude that performance of VGG16 was the best among the 3 models I used.
