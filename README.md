# Comparative-analysis-Drowsiness-Detector-using-MRL Dataset and transfer learning models Resnet-MobileNet-and-VGG16

As a part of my Deep Learning Mini Project 1 - I did a comparative analysis of Drowsiness Detection using MRL Dataset and 3 different transfer learning models - Mobilenet, Resnet and VVG16.
I evaluated the performance based on accuracy, precision and recall. My focus was mainly on precision and recall as I did not want false alarms as well as missing out when the driver is actually drowsy.
This project helped me to conclude that performance of VGG16 was the best among the 3 models I used.


"Inspiration: Unveiling Optimal Drowsiness Detection in Vehicles Through Deep Learning"

Abstract:
In the realm of automotive safety, the imperative to ensure driver alertness and prevent accidents due to drowsiness has propelled the development of cutting-edge technologies. In this pursuit, my Deep Learning Mini Project 1 aimed to comprehensively evaluate and compare the performance of three transfer learning models—MobileNet, ResNet, and VGG16—on the crucial task of drowsiness detection. By employing the Multiview Car Driver Monitoring (MRL) dataset, a substantial benchmark for driver monitoring systems, I delved into a meticulous analysis of accuracy, precision, and recall to ascertain the most effective model for mitigating the risks associated with driver drowsiness.

Inspiration: Unearthing the Optimal Guardian of Driver Vigilance

Introduction:
The inspiration for this project stems from the ever-growing concern for road safety and the dire consequences of driver drowsiness. As I embarked on this journey, my goal was not just to merely develop a drowsiness detection system but to craft a robust, reliable, and responsive solution that could potentially save lives. The idea of empowering a machine to understand human cues of drowsiness and alertness, and subsequently respond with accuracy, intrigued me to explore the realm of deep learning.

Methodology: Bridging Innovation with Practicality

Methodology:
With the MRL dataset as the bedrock of this study, I ventured into the intricacies of transfer learning, utilizing the MobileNet, ResNet, and VGG16 architectures—acclaimed giants in the field of image classification. The crux of my analysis hinged on precision and recall, recognizing the significance of minimizing false positives while avoiding any instances of false negatives. This approach was driven by a pragmatic understanding of the need to strike a balance between mitigating false alarms and ensuring timely alerts in the event of driver drowsiness.

Results: The Triumph of VGG16

Results:
Upon meticulous experimentation and analysis, the data unequivocally revealed the supremacy of the VGG16 model in drowsiness detection. With its intricate architecture and deep layering, VGG16 showcased remarkable precision and recall, seamlessly navigating the complex landscape of driver facial expressions and cues indicative of drowsiness. This culmination of precision and recall, ensuring minimal false positives and negligible false negatives, exemplified VGG16's potential to be an instrumental tool in enhancing road safety.

Discussion: Paving the Road Ahead

Discussion:
The success of VGG16 underscores the critical importance of architectural nuances in deep learning models. The project's findings not only offer a validated pathway for effective drowsiness detection but also pave the way for future exploration in refining model architectures to tackle other intricate tasks in driver monitoring. Furthermore, the project serves as a testament to the power of transfer learning and the indispensability of datasets like MRL in training robust and responsive models.

Conclusion: A Stepping Stone to Safer Roads

Conclusion:
This project, with its unwavering focus on precision and recall, reinforces the notion that the fusion of machine learning and road safety is not just an academic endeavor but a tangible step towards safer roads. The validation of VGG16's prowess in drowsiness detection provides a springboard for the integration of sophisticated technology into vehicles, potentially revolutionizing the way we perceive driver safety. Through this endeavor, I have found inspiration in the potential of technology to be a silent guardian, steadfastly protecting lives on the open road.
